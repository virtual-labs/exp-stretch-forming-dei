### About the Experiment 
Stretch forming is a metal forming process in which sheet metal is stretched and bent simultaneously over a die to produce large contoured parts. The sheet is gripped along its edges by gripping jaws, which are pulled by pneumatic or hydraulic force on a stretch press. The sheet is then wrapped over a stretch form block (form die) to achieve the desired contour.
