## 1. Material Preparation
- Select a ductile sheet metal specimen of specified thickness (e.g., aluminium, steel, or titanium).  
- Clean the surface to remove contaminants such as oil, dust, and oxides.  
- Ensure the sheet is free from scratches, dents, or pre-existing deformation.

## 2. Form Die Setup
- Mount the stretch form block (STFB) securely on the press table.  
- Verify proper alignment of the die relative to the gripping jaws.  
- Ensure the die surface is smooth and free from irregularities.

## 3. Sheet Positioning and Alignment
- Place the sheet metal between the gripping jaws of the stretch press.  
- Align the sheet so that its longitudinal axis is perpendicular to the jaws and centered over the die.  
- Confirm that the sheet lies flat without initial curvature.

## 4. Clamping the Specimen
- Engage the gripping jaws to clamp the sheet along its edges.  
- Apply uniform clamping pressure to avoid slippage during stretching.  
- Ensure the clamping force is suitable for the material thickness.

## 5. Initial Pre-Stretch Application
- Activate the hydraulic or pneumatic system to apply a controlled pre-stretch.  
- This step eliminates slack and stabilizes the sheet for uniform loading.  
- Check for any early signs of wrinkling or uneven tension.

## 6. Controlled Stretching of the Sheet
- Gradually increase tensile force by pulling the jaws outward at a regulated rate.  
- Maintain symmetrical stretching for uniform strain distribution.  
- Continuously monitor elongation and force to avoid localized thinning.

## 7. Forming Phase (Wrapping Over the Die)
- Simultaneously raise the form die (vertical press) or wrap the sheet around the die (horizontal press).  
- Coordinate die displacement with jaw movement to maintain tensile stress.  
- Allow the sheet to plastically deform and conform to the die geometry.

## 8. Achievement of Final Contour
- Continue stretching until the sheet fully matches the die profile.  
- Maintain the tensile load briefly to stabilize the deformation.  
- Reduce chances of elastic springback by holding the load momentarily.

## 9. Release of Tensile Load
- Gradually decrease hydraulic or pneumatic pressure to release tension.  
- Retract the jaws slowly and return the die to its starting position.  
- Avoid sudden unloading to minimize springback effects.

## 10. Part Removal
- Open the gripping jaws and carefully remove the formed component.  
- Handle the part gently to preserve the newly formed contour.

## 11. Inspection and Evaluation
- Examine the part for dimensional accuracy and surface quality.  
- Check for defects such as cracking, wrinkling, rippling, or excessive thinning.  
- Measure final thickness, curvature, and strain distribution.

## 12. Documentation
- Record material specifications, forces applied, displacement values, and observed deformation.  
- Note any defects, measurements, and final shape details for analysis.
