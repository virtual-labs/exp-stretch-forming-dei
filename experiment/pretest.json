      "question": "What is Stretch Forming?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Process of forming various metals into special shapes with special equipment & die",
        "b": "Process of pulling work piece through conical dies",
        "c": "Process to reducing the cross-section work piece",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Stretch forming involves stretching and bending sheet metal over a die to create contoured shapes.",
        "b": "This describes a different metal forming process known as drawing.",
        "c": "This is related to processes like rolling or extrusion, not stretch forming.",
        "d": "Incorrect, as only option (a) correctly defines stretch forming."

        "a": "Aluminium",
        "b": "Brass",
        "c": "Plastic",
        "d": "Wood"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Aluminium is the preferred material due to its ductility and lightweight properties.",
        "b": "Brass is less commonly used in stretch forming.",
        "c": "Plastic is not typically stretch formed in the same manner.",
        "d": "Wood is not used in stretch forming processes."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Stretch forming is extensively used in aerospace to shape fuselage panels.",
        "b": "Injection molding is a different manufacturing process.",
        "c": "Casting involves pouring molten metal into molds, not stretching.",
        "d": "Thermoforming is used for plastics, not metal stretch forming."

      "question": "Which of the following metals can be stretch formed?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Aluminium",
        "b": "Stainless steel",
        "c": "Nickel-based steels",
        "d": "Titanium"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Aluminium is commonly used due to its excellent formability.",
        "b": "Stainless steel can be stretch formed, though less commonly than aluminium.",
        "c": "Nickel-based steels are less common for stretch forming due to their hardness.",
        "d": "Titanium is also used, especially in aerospace applications."

    {
      "question": "Bending is better because ________:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Minimum bend radius is generally 2-3 times greater than other forming methods",
        "b": "Minimum bend radius is generally 4-6 times greater than other forming methods",
        "c": "Minimum bend radius is generally 1-6 times greater than other forming methods",
        "d": "Minimum bend radius is generally 6-8 times greater than other forming methods"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "In stretch forming, the minimum bend radius is usually 2-3 times the material thickness.",
        "b": "This is not typical for stretch forming.",
        "c": "This range is too broad and not specific to stretch forming.",
        "d": "This range is exaggerated and not accurate for stretch forming."
