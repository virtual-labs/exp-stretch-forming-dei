# Stretch Forming

## Introduction
Stretch forming is a metal forming process in which sheet metal is **stretched and bent simultaneously** over a die to produce large contoured parts. The sheet is gripped along its edges by **gripping jaws**, which are pulled by pneumatic or hydraulic force on a stretch press. The sheet is then wrapped over a **stretch form block (form die)** to achieve the desired contour.

The most common stretch presses are:
- **Vertical stretch presses** – the form die is raised into the sheet using a hydraulic ram.
- **Horizontal stretch presses** – the form die is fixed, and jaws pull the sheet horizontally around it.

As the sheet stretches, **tensile forces increase** and the metal undergoes **plastic deformation**, taking the shape of the die.

## Precision and Capabilities
Stretch forming is known for its **high accuracy and precision**, making it suitable for producing:
- Intricate multi-component assemblies  
- Snap-together curtain wall components  
- Smooth, uniform, and ripple-free surfaces  
- Large-radius bends and complex curved profiles  

Shapes possible include:
- Portions of circles  
- Ellipses  
- Parabolas  
- Arched shapes  
- Curved surfaces with straight legs  

This reduces additional fabrication steps such as welding and bending.

## Working Principle
The process involves stretching a metal piece over a **male stretch form block (STFB)** using a hydraulic or pneumatic stretch press.  
The sheet is **not drawn** into the die (unlike deep drawing). Instead, it is stretched with **uniform thinning and elongation**.

## Materials Used
Ductile materials are preferred:

- **Aluminium**
- **Steel**
- **Titanium**

---

## Applications
Stretch formed parts are typically **large curved components**, such as:

- Aircraft wing panels  
- Automotive door and body panels  
- Window systems and skylights  
- Storefronts and curtain walls  
- Hand railings and walkway enclosures  
- Signs and architectural frameworks  
- Window frames and enclosures  

Benefits:
- Close and consistent tolerances  
- No surface distortion, ripples, or marring  
- Smooth and even surface finish  
- Suitable for large aluminium, stainless steel, and titanium parts  
- Quick and highly repeatable

## Types of Stretch Forming

### **1. Sheet Stretch Forming**
Used extensively in:
- Manufacturing aircraft fuselage skin sections  
- Aerospace-grade aluminium alloy sheets  

### **2. Extrusion Stretch Forming**
Used for:
- Contouring aluminium aerospace extrusion profiles  
- Roll-formed profiles  
- Press-braked shapes  

These presses are also known as **stretch wrap** or **swing arm presses**.  
They use:
- Two swinging arms  
- Multiple gripping jaws  
- Hydraulic tension cylinders to stretch and wrap the workpiece around the die
