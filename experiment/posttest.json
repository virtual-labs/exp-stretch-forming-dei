        "a": "Unlimited",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Stretch forming allows very large bend radii because the sheet is stretched, not just bent.",
        "b": "Die shape influences radius, but not the absolute maximum.",
        "c": "30 cm is not a defined limit for stretch forming.",
        "d": "60 cm is also not a defined limit."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Stretch forming produces smooth surfaces because the material is uniformly stretched.",
        "b": "Incorrect; it does not create high distortion.",

        "a": "Arms typically swing up to 180° for wrapping around the die.",

        "a": "They can be formed but usually they twist during forming, making this incorrect.",
        "b": "Correct; non-symmetric profiles tend to twist under tension during stretch forming.",
